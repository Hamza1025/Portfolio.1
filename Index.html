                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>Hi! My name is Hamza. I am 23 years old.
                    <br> 
                    I have been learning to code since the start of 2022. 
                    <br>
                    My goal is to complete the coding course by the end of 2022 and become a software developer. 
                </p>

                <p> I believe myself to be a dependable and trustworthy individual who can operate alone with little supervision.
                    <br>
                    I am a timely person with excellent time management abilities in all facets of my life, 
                    <br>
                    both professional and personal. When necessary, I can adjust to various situations in a <br>
                    resourceful manner.
                    <br> 
                    I have a wide range of transferable skills that benefit me in both work and school. 
                    <br>
                    I have outstanding communication abilities that I can apply to a variety of situations and people.
                    <br>
                     My ability to converse fluently in English, Urdu, and Punjabi is aided by my fluency.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>In my free time I learn about new technologies, such as new software and how to programme new software
                    <br> and see how it all works. 
                    I enjoy reading books and participating in sports such as cricket and football. 
                    <br>
                    I also enjoy exploring new areas that I have never visited before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun fact! I've been programing for
                    <span id="time-container">0</span> seconds!
